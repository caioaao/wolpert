# Wolpert, a stacked generalization framework

## Install

While the next scikit learn's version is not released, we're using the fork with
some modifications on the pipeline class.

1. Clone the repo with its submodules using `git clone --recursive ...`
2. Enter `wolpert` directory and run `dev_tools/dev_env.sh`. There are some
   options you can control by modifying the environment variables there. The
   default install is using conda and python 3
